<h2 align="center">CalendarBot</h2>

CalendarBot is an ISC-licensed Discord Bot designed to be a community driven Calendar application.

CalendarBot is also an open source project, which we started as a way to practice Node.js applications development, so feel free to help us improve by contributing to the project!


---


## Introduction

CalendarBot was initially planned to be an easy solution to track homeworks and tests for my promotion. But as we went along, we continued to add more and more features, finally making it a real Calendar Application for Discord.

Of course, it wasn't made to replace your Smartphone Calendar app, but to be an easy way for Discord communities to schedule things, and having people access that schedule.

#### Add CalendarBot to your Discord Guild!

You can benefit from all CalendarBot's features by simply adding it to your Discord Guild with [this invitation link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=473070839085137933&scope=bot&permissions=1409674304&response_type=code).

*(Please note that the bot requires the selected permissions in order to be fully-functionnal.)*
